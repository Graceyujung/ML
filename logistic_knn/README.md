## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
The notebook includes:
- Data preprocessing and exploration
- Implementation of **Logistic Regression** and **KNN**
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
- Hyperparameter tuning for **KNN**
- **Comparison of model performance** using different **train-test splits** (70/30 and 60/40)

## ðŸ“‚ Files
- `Grace_logistic_KNN.ipynb`
-  Jupyter notebook containing the full implementation
- `README.md`: Project documentation

## ðŸ”§ Installation & Usage
To run this notebook, ensure you have the following installed:

 ```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
